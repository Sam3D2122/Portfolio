                <h3>PsychoPigs</h3>
                <p>The first official game released by Italia 3D Academy. In this project, published for free on Steam, I served as the Lead Programmer. I guided the Academy's students throughout its development, leading up to the project's launch on April 25, 2025</p>

                <h3>Umbricius Ludus</h3>
                <p>An ambitious project developed by Italia 3D Academy and the Poliziani High School of Montepulciano. I was responsible for training the students and for the Unreal Engine development of the title. The project features several mini-games, all playable with both mouse and keyboard as well as with a controller. Additionally, using photogrammetry-based models, I handled optimization by leveraging both Nanite and Lumen technologies.</p>

                <h3>End Ink</h3>
                <p>A personal project I have been working on for a few months. It is a storytelling experience where the player embodies a drop of ink tasked with writing the word "The End" at the conclusion of a story.</p>

                <h3>Megalo Splash</h3>
                <p>A reimagining of the classic Hangman game for VR headsets. Set aboard a pirate ship, players must guess the correct word — if they lose, they fall into the water and are eaten by a shark. For this project, I was responsible for gameplay programming and optimization to ensure the best performance on VR headsets (specifically Meta Quest 2/3).</p>

                <p>A demo currently in development that supports and utilizes SpatialLabs platform technologies. Through Acer, I had the opportunity to create this demo for their monitors and laptops that feature the mentioned technology. During development, I had the chance to work directly with some of the developers involved in building the platform's APIs. </p>
